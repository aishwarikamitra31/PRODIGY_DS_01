Histogram for Age Distribution
The histogram below displays the distribution of ages in the sample population. The x-axis represents the age groups, while the y-axis represents the frequency of individuals in each age group. A kernel density estimate (KDE) line is overlaid to show the distribution's shape more smoothly.

Interpretation:
The histogram shows that the ages in the sample population are uniformly distributed across the age range from 18 to 80, with no significant skew or outliers. The KDE line confirms this uniform distribution.

Bar Chart for Gender Distribution
The bar chart below illustrates the distribution of genders in the sample population. The x-axis represents the gender categories, while the y-axis represents the count of individuals in each category.

Interpretation:
The bar chart indicates a nearly equal distribution of males and females in the sample population. This balanced distribution ensures that the sample does not show any gender bias.

Conclusion
The visualizations provide a clear understanding of the sample population's age and gender distributions. The histogram and KDE line for ages indicate a uniform distribution, while the bar chart for genders shows an almost equal representation of males and females. These insights can be valuable for further analysis and decision-making based on the demographic characteristics of the population.
